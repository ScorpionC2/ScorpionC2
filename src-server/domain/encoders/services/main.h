#include "../types/main.h"

/*
 * This file must contain all encoders as pointers to their implementations.
 * Example:
 *      #include "xor/main.h" // this main.h declares extern XorInstance.
 *      
 *      extern EncoderInstance Xor = XorInstance
 * 
 * The idea is to have all encoders in just one file, without the need to include every implementation.
